      <h2><span class="highlight-5">Critique and Iteration</span></h2>
      <p>
        We presented our hifi mockups to an industry critic and our peers in our user interface and user experience class to receive feedback on the designs and prototypes that we had created. 
        This was really useful in helping us improve our designs because it allowed us to understand how new users would interact with and interpret our designs.
      </p>
      <p>Some key points of feedback that we received and our solutions to those issues:</p>
      <div class="critiques">
        <div class="point flex row">
          <div class="problem col-6">
            The effect of the “Cancel” button is unclear: does it close the appointment popup or cancel the appointment itself? 
          </div>
          <div class="solution col-6">
            “Cancel” was rephrased to “Cancel Appointment”, and added an “X” on the top right of the appointment popup to close the popup.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="point flex row">
          <div class="problem col-6">
            Scheduling appointments is a key feature, and should also be accessible from the home page. Redundancy is ok in this context.
          </div>
          <div class="solution col-6">
            A “Schedule Appointments” button was added directly to the home page, in a highly visible space.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="point flex row">
          <div class="problem col-6">
            Finding new therapists is crucial to the app’s mission, and should be made more accessible.
          </div>
          <div class="solution col-6">
            A “Search” tab was added to the bottom navbar. Clicking on “Search” brought users to a page where exploring and matching with new therapists is the main functionality (as opposed to scheduling an appointment, which is the main functionality of the “Schedule” tab).
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="point flex row">
          <div class="problem col-6">
            When new messages are received, a notification signal on the messages tab in the bottom navbar would be helpful.
          </div>
          <div class="solution col-6">
            When there are unread messages, a notification icon appears on the “Messages” tab in the bottom navbar to bring attention to new messages.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="point flex row">
          <div class="problem col-6">
            A therapist’s profile should be accessible both from the chat function, and from the “your primary therapist” section in the profile page.
          </div>
          <div class="solution col-6">
            <p>In a chat screen, an “information” icon was added besides the therapist’s profile icon that brings the user to the therapist’s full profile.
              </p>
            <p>In the profile page, “your primary therapist” is now displayed as a card (in the same format as search results), and clicking it brings the user to the therapist’s full profile.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="point flex row">
          <div class="problem col-6">
            Missing an option to set someone as your primary therapist.
          </div>
          <div class="solution col-6">
            A button was added to the therapist profile page to set the current therapist as the user’s primary therapist.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="point-last flex row">
          <div class="problem col-6">
            Inconsistencies in data (eg. names, dates, times) across different screens.
          </div>
          <div class="solution col-6">
            The prototype was re-organized, and any inconsistencies in information were fixed.
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Finally we combined all of this feedback and new ideas and incorporated them into an improved version of our prototype.</p>
      <p>The final version can be found here: </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2><span class="highlight-6">User Testing</span></h2>
      <p>We then submitted this finalized prototype to external users (on UserTesting.com) for one last iteration of review. </p>
      <p>We asked these testers to use our prototype to accomplish the following tasks:</p>
      <ul>1. You want to make an appointment with your primary therapist. Schedule an appointment for November 9th with Mary.</ul>
      <ul>2. You just remembered you're busy on November 9th. Reschedule your appointment for November 10th.</ul>
      <p>Our three user tests can be found here:</p>
      <div class="contained row align-items-center justify-content-center ">
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mexckt44bcnYvfGgLxIQq-k_m9V9YPYP/view?usp=sharing" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg active site-btn " style="background-color: #edceea; border-color: #edceea; color: black; margin-right: 70px;" role="button" aria-pressed="true">User 1</a>
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m_eARAY_Lk604PckBTY83u7nyw_o-o-4/view?usp=sharing" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg active site-btn " style="background-color: #edceea; border-color: #edceea; color: black; margin-right: 70px;" role="button" aria-pressed="true">User 2</a>
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/145TqiNT_i8AIqnQUr6k2hiNmpwcY435l/view?usp=sharing " class="btn btn-primary btn-lg active site-btn" style="background-color: #edceea; border-color: #edceea; color: black; " role="button" aria-pressed="true">User 3</a>
      </div>
      <p>By examining their behavior and interactions with the mockups when asked to complete these tasks, we found that the overall structure of our mockup was quite effective. Here are some key findings:</p>
      <ul>Most users noted that they recognized exactly where to look to accomplish the tasks we asked for and that they enjoyed the smooth and easy follow flow between pages and tasks. </ul>
      <ul>Generally our users were able to complete the task quickly and effectively with no difficulties or mistakes.</ul>
      <ul>One user did not actually click on a time slot to book an appointment and believed that she had already booked it once arriving at the therapists page. </ul>
      <p>Following the completion of these tasks, we asked the users to answer these questions:</p>
      <ul>1. What frustrated you most about this app?</ul>
      <ul>2. What's one thing you'd change about the app?</ul>
      <ul>3. What did you like most about the app?</ul>
      <p>Ultimately, our three testers provided mostly positive feedback. All three liked the visual layout of the app and found it comprehensive and easy to navigate and use. One user suggested that we could include more integration with other applications such as google maps and google calendar to make it even easier for the user, which would definitely be a great addition for the next iteration of this design. Another thing that we would change in the next iteration would be adding more affordances to guide users through their interactions, and rephrasing some of the titles of our sections to be more explicit and intuitive.</p>

      <h2><span class="highlight-7">Outreach</span></h2>
      <p>Finally, we reached out to the original startup over email. In the email, we introduced ourselves, included a link to the hi-fi prototype, and explained the motivation behind our UIUX design choices. </p>

      <h2><span class="highlight-8">Conclusion</span></h2>
      <p>This project was a great chance to apply UIUX principles in a real-world context, and our team had a lot of fun throughout the design process. The group format was an amazing opportunity to both collaborate with fellow UIUX students while learning from each other; moreover, the fact that we were basing our designs off a real startup made our project feel that much more impactful. Overall, this project was a great exercise in design, teamwork, and creativity.</p>
