      <p>
        We presented our hifi mockups to an industry critic and our peers in our user interface and user experience class to receive feedback on the designs and prototypes that we had created. 
        This was really useful in helping us improve our designs because it allowed us to understand how new users would interact with and interpret our designs.
      </p>
      <p>Some key points of feedback that we received and our solutions to those issues:</p>

          <div class="problem">

      <p>Finally, we reached out to the original startup over email. In the email, we introduced ourselves, included a link to the hi-fi prototype, and explained the motivation behind our UIUX design choices. </p>

      <h2><span class="highlight-8">Conclusion</span></h2>
      <p>This project was a great chance to apply UIUX principles in a real-world context, and our team had a lot of fun throughout the design process. The group format was an amazing opportunity to both collaborate with fellow UIUX students while learning from each other; moreover, the fact that we were basing our designs off a real startup made our project feel that much more impactful. Overall, this project was a great exercise in design, teamwork, and creativity.</p>
